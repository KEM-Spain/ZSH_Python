-- Stuff I develop and use everyday --

Many zsh utilities, some perl, and some python.

For zsh, there is a library of various useful functions.
For zsh apps based on the library, there is built in debugging support.

Perl is embedded in a few library functions.

As for python, there is a torrent search engine developed to sit on top of deluge.
